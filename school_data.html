        <h1>Understanding school data</h1>
        <p>There are so many different high schools and high school programs to choose from! How do you decide which one to go to?</p>
        <p>Some might have the right sports team or a cool mascot, but how do you know which one will prepare you for a successful future?</p>
        <p>Below are some types of data that you can use to help you decide which school is the best one for you.</p>

            <h2>Freshman On-track</h2>
            <p>The Freshman on Track rate tells you the percentage of 9th graders that are on-track to graduate after their first year of high school. For example, a rate of 85% means that in a class of 100 9th graders, 85 will be on-track by the end of the year.</p>

            <p>What does it mean to be on-track? On-track students have no more than 1 semester F in their core 9th grade courses (English, Math, Social Studies, and Science). The more classes they fail, the harder it is to make them up over the summer and at night school, so students who are off-track tend to fall behind and become much less likely to graduate.</p>

            <p>The best thing about Freshman on-track? The research shows that it doesn’t matter what your test scores are when you come into high school—if you can get on-track your Freshman year, you’ll be much more likely to graduate and will be set up for success in high school and beyond!</p>

          <div class="panel-body school-data">
            <h2>Average ACT</h2>
            <p>The ACT is a standardized test consisting of multiple-choice items in four different subjects, with overall (composite) scores ranging from 0 to 36. Your own ACT score is very important for determining where you can go to college (colleges look at it when you apply), and may also influence your ability to get scholarships. Your school’s average ACT score is also important—colleges use it as a signal for the quality of your high school. You could do the same thing when you choose which high school to attend!</p>

          <div class="panel-body school-data">
            <h2>Attendance</h2>
            <p>A school’s average attendance rate represents the average percentage of students that are in school on a given day—for example, an attendance rate of 90% means that on an average day, 90 out of 100 students are in school.</p>

            <p>Being is school is important for success! Research shows that attendance is the biggest predictor of Freshman on Track, which we know is a huge predictor of high school graduation. Students with high test scores who miss a lot of school are more likely to fail than students with low test scores who are rarely absent.</p>

            <h2>High School Graduation Rate</h2>
            <p>This one is pretty simple! The high school graduation rate represents the percentage of students who entered the school as freshman who ultimately graduated within 4 years. A graduation rate of 80% means that of every 100 9th graders who come in, 80 of them will graduate from high school within 4 years. Students do not necessarily need to graduate from the same high school where they started to be counted, as long as they graduate from somewhere.</p>
            <p>We all know why high school graduation matters—it’s essential if you want to go to college!</p>

            <h2>College Enrollment</h2>
            <p>The college enrollment rate tells you what percentage of graduating seniors enrolled in college the next fall. An enrollment rate of 75% means that for every 100 graduates, 75 enrolled in college in the fall after their high school graduation. High schools can do a lot to influence their college enrollment rates, from better preparing students to get accepted to college (raising ACT scores, improving grades, and increasing the likelihood of graduation), to helping students navigate the complicated admissions process (filling out applications, getting letters of recommendation, applying for scholarships), to making sure that students have everything they need over the summer so they are prepared to start college in the fall.</p>
            <p>Getting to college is hugely important for success in life: The median annual income for those with a Bachelor’s degree is more than $20,000 more than those with only a high school degree!</p>

            <h2>College Persistence</h2>
            <p>The college persistence rate tells you the percentage of students who enrolled in college in the fall after their high school graduation who came back for their sophomore year of college. If 100 students enrolled in the fall, but only 65% came back for year 2, the persistence rate would be 65%.</p>
            <p>College persistence is important because there’s a huge income gap between people with some college and people who have a college degree. It’s not enough to get to college—you need to stay there!</p>

            <p>High school is an important step in your educational life, as it helps to prepare you for college or your future career, and provides opportunities for learning essential components of personal development, including self-discipline, time management, decision-making, and teamwork. Because students have different interests, abilities, and needs, the Chicago Public Schools offers a wide variety of schools and programs to ensure that you are able to find the right fit.</p>
            <p>Some high schools have multiple types of program and you can look to apply to a specific program to suit your interests and career goals.</p>
