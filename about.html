        <h1>About High Schools</h1>
        <p>High school is an important step in your educational life, as it helps to prepare you for college or your future career, and provides opportunities for learning essential components of personal development, including self-discipline, time management, decision-making, and teamwork. Because students have different interests, abilities, and needs, the Chicago Public Schools offers a wide variety of schools and programs to ensure that you are able to find the right fit.</p>
        <p>Some high schools have multiple types of program and you can look to apply to a specific program to suit your interests and career goals.</p>
